            <p class="block_text">Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.
               A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.
               One key difference between a typical database and a blockchain is how the data is structured. A blockchain collects information together in groups, known as blocks, 
               that hold sets of information. Blocks have certain storage capacities and, when filled, are closed and linked to the previously filled block, forming a chain of data known as the blockchain.
               All new information that follows that freshly added block is compiled into a newly formed block that will then also be added to the chain once filled.
            </p>
